    <h1>Kata: Well of Ideas - Easy Version</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      For every good kata idea there seem to be quite a few bad ones!<br />
      <br />
      In this kata you need to check the provided array (x) for good <br />
      ideas 'good' and bad ideas 'bad'. If there are one or two good <br />
      ideas, return 'Publish!', if there are more than 2 return 'I <br />
      smell a series!'. If there are no good ideas, as is often the <br />
      case, return 'Fail!'.<br />
